title: "Daily Market Return Prediction with Transformer"
collection: research
category: workingpaper
permalink: /research/transformer-market-prediction
excerpt: 'We apply a Transformer encoder to forecast daily market returns using lagged market returns over horizons of 5, 20, and 60 days. Both the direct model forecasts and post-machine learning forecasts exhibit significant predictive power for next-day returns, while simple averages of past returns do not. Relative to linear predictive regressions, the machine learning forecasts deliver sizable improvements in out-of-sample R-squared. A mean-variance analysis with a risk-aversion coefficient of two shows that the Transformer prediction generates an average return of 30% per annum with a Sharpe ratio of 1.3. The predictability is more pronounced in recessions and periods of elevated investor sentiment. Random Forests and feed-forward Neural Networks also yield economically meaningful, though somewhat weaker, results.'
