I am a senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill pursuing dual Bachelor of Science degrees in Computer Science and Economics with a minor in Mathematics. I am currently working on my Senior Honors Thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Marlon Azinovic-Yang]([link-to-advisor](https://sites.google.com/view/marlonazinovic/home)), examining ESG asset pricing using heterogeneous agent models and deep equilibrium networks.

My research interests span empirical asset pricing and corporate finance, with a focus on applying computational methods to financial markets. In asset pricing, I study market return predictability and factor models using machine learning techniques. In corporate finance, I examine how investor preferences for sustainability impact asset prices and capital allocation. I am also interested in how political dynamics and policy uncertainty affect financial markets and corporate decision-making.

I am applying to Finance PhD programs for Fall 2026.

## Working Papers
* **Daily Market Return Prediction with Transformer** (with Yufeng Han and Guofu Zhou) 
* **Sustainable Asset Pricing with Heterogeneous Agents: A Computational Approach**
